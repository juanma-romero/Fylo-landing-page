## My process

This was my hardest project. Not complex but long  (550 lines in css) Maybe it wasn't the best approach to use pure css.
First, I struggled a lot with positioning divs. In the middle of the project, I realized the importance of grid and flexbox for that work, so I changed to these tools, this facilitated centering. But I will have to practice more of that subjects

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Have to plan before start to coding!!

### Continued development

Have to use more flexbox and grid for lay-out and centering
